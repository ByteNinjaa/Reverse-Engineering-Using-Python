# Reverse-Engineering-Using-Python

**Introduction**

Reverse engineering using Python involves the process of analyzing and understanding existing software or systems by deconstructing them and extracting valuable information or functionality. Python, being a versatile and powerful programming language, provides a range of tools and libraries that aid in reverse engineering tasks. By utilizing Python, developers can disassemble binaries, reverse engineer protocols, analyze file formats, debug applications, and extract data or logic from proprietary software. Python's flexibility and extensive ecosystem make it an excellent choice for reverse engineering projects, enabling practitioners to delve into the inner workings of software systems and gain insights that would otherwise remain hidden.

I will be using a free game called "Skeletris". It can be downloaded from this site:
